The error message \"Method 'GET' not allowed\" typically indicates that the server is configured to only accept specific HTTP methods, such as POST, PUT, or DELETE, but not GET. This could be due to various reasons, such as:\n\n1. Server-side configuration: The server might be configured to only accept specific HTTP methods for a particular endpoint or resource.\n2. Authentication or authorization: The server might require authentication or authorization to access certain resources, and the GET method is not allowed for unauthenticated or unauthorized requests.\n3. API or framework restrictions: Some APIs or frameworks might restrict the use of GET methods for certain operations.\n\nTo resolve this issue, you can try the following:\n\n1. Check the server documentation: Verify the server's documentation to see if there are any specific requirements or restrictions on HTTP methods.\n2. Use an alternative method: Try using a different HTTP method, such as POST, PUT, or DELETE, to access the resource.\n3. Provide authentication or authorization: If authentication or authorization is required, provide the necessary credentials or tokens to access the resource.\n4. Contact the server administrator: If none of the above steps work, contact the server administrator or developer to investigate the issue.\n\nIf you have any specific questions or need further assistance, please let me know."
